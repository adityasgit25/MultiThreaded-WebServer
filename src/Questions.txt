Why is Socket used for networking?
It provides reliable, bidirectional communication over TCP.

What happens if the server is down when the client attempts to connect?
A ConnectException is thrown.

How would you modify this for a multi-threaded server?
You'd manage each client connection in a separate thread or use non-blocking I/O with java.nio.

What is the significance of using localhost?
It ensures the client communicates with a server running on the same machine.

What is the purpose of ServerSocket?
It listens for incoming client connections on a specified port.

Why use Runnable for multithreading?
Allows concurrent execution while separating task logic from thread management.

What challenges arise with multithreading?
- Thread Safety: Shared resources (if any) must be synchronized to avoid race conditions.
- Resource Management: High thread count can lead to high memory and CPU usage.

How would you further optimize this code?
- Use a thread pool (ExecutorService) to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads.
- Switch to non-blocking I/O with java.nio for better scalability.

Executer Service

What is ExecutorService in Java?
- Core Purpose
The primary goal of ExecutorService is to:
    - Decouple task submission from thread management.
        You submit tasks to the ExecutorService, and it handles thread creation, scheduling, and execution.
    - Provide thread pooling.
        Threads are reused for multiple tasks, reducing the overhead of frequent thread creation and destruction.
    - Manage lifecycle.
        It provides methods to gracefully start, manage, and shut down threads.
