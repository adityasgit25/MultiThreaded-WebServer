How the Server Works
1. Startup:
 The server starts listening on port 8010.
2. Accept Connections:
 When a client connects, the server:
 - Accepts the connection.
 - Logs the client's details.
3. Respond:
 Sends a message to the client.
4. Repeat:
 The server remains active and processes one client connection at a time due to its single-threaded nature.


Questions (Single Threaded specific):
What happens if a second client connects while the first is being processed?
The second client will wait (block) until the server finishes processing the first client.
